== Development Widgets: URL's ==
Codeigniter has an extension in the library Router to make it possible to have another folder-structure and URL's. When calling for a controller for a widget, use this syntax:
    
_*SITE_URL + "/widget/(name)/(controller)"*_ where _*(name)*_ is the name of the widget and _*(controller)*_ is the name of the controller.

*Example*:<br>
SITE_URL + "/widget/iframe_template/main"; this will call the controller main for the widget iframe_template.
